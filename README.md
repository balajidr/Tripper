A Web application to plan trips with your friends. (College Project).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This app is built over the Flask Microframework for Python.
  
  It is a simple web app that allows users to form groups and plan trips.
  Some of it's features are :
   -> 1. Add contacts from your Google Contacts.
   -> 2. Form groups from your list of Friends.
   -> 3. Search for various locations and get informations.
   -> 4. Chat with your Friends while searching for locations with Google maps.
   -> 5. All the chats are saved and the planning can be continued later.
    
  Google Contacts API, Google Places API and Google GeoCoding API are used to get 
  the information about users and places.
  
  Flaws in the Application are :
    -> 1. The Chat system is NOT INSTANT. It is similar to USER POSTS.
    -> 2. When a group is formed there is no ADMIN for the group.
    -> 3. A User can be part of ONE GROUP only.
    -> 4. Passwords are not Hashed while storing in the Database.
